Selected items, by postcode, 2018â€“19 income year

For each postcode, we show the count of individuals, the average and median amounts of key items, as well as the proportion of individuals claiming these items.

Note: Counts, medians and averages are generated using all individuals for the fields taxable income or loss, total income or loss and total deductions which will include reported zeroes and a default value of zero where the value was unknown. Counts, medians and averages for net rent include all individuals who reported at the label, whether the value was zero or not. All remaining fields include only individuals who had a non-zero value for the field.
